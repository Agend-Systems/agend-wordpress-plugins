# Agend Content Access

Restricts WordPress content to Agend members and membership plans.

Implements SPEC-CMS-20260727-wordpress-member-content-access.

## The one rule

**WordPress declares the intended audience. Agend decides whether the current
visitor belongs to it.**

The browser never makes that decision, and never receives protected material it
cannot display. No access decision in this plugin reads WordPress user metadata,
WordPress roles, or WooCommerce.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Required? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WordPress 6.0+ | yes | |
| PHP 7.4+ | yes | |
| Agend Apps Core | **yes** | Transport, API key storage, member bearer contract, plan catalogue |
| Elementor Pro | optional | Fragment-level policies. Without it, whole post and page policies still work |

Explicitly NOT required, and never to be added: ACF, WooCommerce, WooCommerce
Memberships, the Iugo plugin, or any particular theme. The reference environment
is a plain WordPress install with Elementor Pro (Decision 2.16).

### Elementor versions

- **Build target: 3.x.** Fragment work is written against the 3.x control and
  rendering APIs.
- **Validated on: 4.x.** The first target site runs Elementor 4.2.0, so 4.x is a
  release gate rather than an afterthought (US-4.4).

A version outside the supported range surfaces an admin notice. Support is not
implied by the code happening to run.

### What the document parser supports

The connector flattens an Elementor page into one fragment per widget, folding
each ancestor's policy down into it.

| Node type | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| `section`, `column`, `container` | Structural. Not a fragment; its policy folds into descendants |
| `widget` | A fragment, carrying the intersection of every policy above it |
| anything else | **Fails the sync revision**, naming the node type |

Failing is deliberate. Skipping an unknown node is how a restricted region
silently stops being represented, after which Agend serves content it never
learned to gate.

**Editor V4 atomic widgets are a known limitation.** They extend `Widget_Base`
rather than `Widget_Common_Base`, and use a props schema instead of
`Controls_Manager` sections, so no per-widget Agend Access control can be
offered on them. Document policies and suppression still apply, because
`Atomic_Element_Base` extends `Element_Base` and the `should_render` filter
still fires. So a V4 page is protected at the page level; only per-section
restriction is unavailable.

Widget content extraction is best-effort: a widget type whose text this does not
recognise still produces a fragment carrying its policy, with
`payload.extracted` false. That is a fidelity gap, never a security one. The
region renders empty rather than to the wrong audience.

## What this plugin owns

Document policies, Elementor fragment policies, the source connector, direct
WordPress request gating, protected assets, and the legacy migration.

## What it does NOT own

Transport, API keys, environment URLs, portal resolution, member login, or token
minting. All of that is Agend Apps Core's, consumed through its published
interfaces:

| Interface | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `agend_apps_api()` | Outbound gateway calls |
| `agend_apps_get_bearer_token()` / the `agend_apps_bearer_token` filter | Member identity |
| `agend_apps_crm_get_tiers()` | Membership plan catalogue for the editor |
| `Agend_Apps_Cache` / `Agend_Apps_Settings::get_cache_ttl()` | Caching |

Reaching into Core internals rather than these is a review failure.

## Failure behaviour

Fail closed, without exception. An empty or malformed policy restricts. An
unresolvable tier never grants. An entitlement lookup failure redacts and logs.
A missing dependency registers nothing rather than half-registering, because a
half-registered access-control plugin is indistinguishable from one that decided
the visitor may proceed.

## Running the tests

From the repository root:

```sh
composer install
composer test                        # the whole collection
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite agend-content-access
```

These are UNIT tests: no database and no WordPress bootstrap. WordPress
functions are stubbed in `tests/wp-stubs.php`, which keeps the suite fast and
removes the wp-tests install step that usually stops WordPress plugin suites
from being run at all. Anything needing real WordPress behaviour (hook ordering
across plugins, actual REST dispatch, database state) belongs in an integration
suite against a real install, which does not exist yet.

## Status

Under construction.

| Story | State |
| --- | --- |
| US-3.1 scaffold and dependency gate | done |
| US-3.3 membership plan catalogue | done |
| US-3.2 native post and page policy panel | done |
| US-3.4 direct WordPress request gating | done |
| US-3.5 source connector | done |
| US-4.1 / US-4.2 Elementor fragment policies | done |

Policies are authored and enforced on the WordPress side, and the source
connector exposes them to Agend behind a rotatable service credential
(Settings, Agend Content Access). Still missing: US-3.6, the gateway write
surface that receives them, so nothing is ingested yet.
